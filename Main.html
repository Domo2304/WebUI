    <p>Welcome to Stephen's FIRE (Financial independence/Retire early website!).</p>
    <p>In the about page, you will learn more about FIRE, how it is achieved, and the community.</p>
    <p>The FIRE calculator can be used to calculate various rates of expenditure, savings, and investment returns to calculate if or when one would achieve financial independence with the entered values.</p>
    <p>In the "simple math behind early retirement" section, you can find out more about the mathematical  principles that allow people to retire quicker than the traditional age of 65. In addition, you will find a guide that lists how long it takes to do so with a 4% investment return based on the percentage of salary saved.</p>
