  <h2>About FIRE</h2>
  <p>FIRE stands for "Financial independence/Retire early", although those who still work after reaching financial independence often refer to it as "Financial independence/Recreationally employed".</p>
  <p>Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) is a movement dedicated to a program of extreme savings and investment that allows proponents to retire far earlier than traditional budgets and retirement plans would allow. By dedicating a higher than typical proportion of income to savings, followers of the FIRE movement may eventually be able to quit their jobs and live solely off small withdrawals from their portfolios decades before the conventional retirement age of 65.</p>
  <p>FIRE is particularly popular among software engineers, as their above-average salaries allow them to save a greater proportion of their incomes, and the possibility of working online allows them to relocate to lower cost of income areas. However, the principles of FIRE are applicable to all salary ranges, and there are even examples of people retiring early on minimum wage.</p>

  <h2>Key principles of FIRE!</h2>
<div id = "panel" style="display: none;">

  <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>Savings: Save more of your income (typically 50%+) than the average person.</li>
    <li>Budgeting: budget your income and expenses to ensure you are getting the most value out of your expenditures.</li>
    <li>Investments: invest your savings until they are worth 300 times your monthly expenses. At this value, based on typical market returns for investments, you will be able to indefinitely live off your investments.</li>
  </ul>
